# what do we call the = in programming?
# we call the single equal sign = assignment,
# it assigns the right side value to the left side varialbe

# in programming if we want to compare left and right are equal, we use double equal sign
# x = 2
# y = 1
# print(x == y) # compare if x and y are equal
# print(2*3 == 6)
# # we also use != to compare not equal, if left and right are not equal
# print(1 != 1)
#
# a = 2*3 != 5
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# # == != > < >= <=
# print(1 < 10)
# print(0 >= 1) # if 2 is bigger than 1 or 2 is equal to 1

# boolean operation: the calculating between boolean
# we have three boolean operator, just like + -  in math, but + - is for number operation
# and or not, they are boolean operators and they are python keywords
# a = True
# b = False
# # we define: for "and" operator, as long as one side is False the result is False
# print(a and b)
# print(True and False)
# print(False and True)
# print(False and False)
# # we define: for "or" operator, as long as one side is True then the result is True
# print(a or b)
# print(True or False)
# print(False or True)
# print(False or False)
# # "not" operator is the reverse of value
# print(not a)
# print(not b)

# == != > < >= <= comparison operator is comparing the numbers
# they generate boolean as result
# print(1 < 10)
# print(2 >= 0)
# # equal to
# print(2 > 0 or 2 == 0)
# # and or not boolean operator, they are used for boolean operator
# # the result is still boolean
# x = True
# y = False
# print(x and y)

# x = 1
# y = '1'
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# # compare equality of x and y, they are not equal
# # because they are not the same type
# print(x == y)

# x = 'He said: "The answer is 42"'
