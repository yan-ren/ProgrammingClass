# # 1 belongs to integer type
# age = 1
#
# # python has two types to represent numbers, integer and float
# # variable age holds integer value 1
#
# money = 1.2
# # variable money holds float value 1.2
# print(money)
# # to know the type inside the variable
# print(type(age))
# print(type(money))

# a = 5
# b = 3
# print(a + b * a)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b) # float division, the division result is always in float
# print(a // b) # integer division, the division result is always in int
# print(a ** b)
# print(a % b) # mod

# example how many seconds in 2 mins
# min = 2
# print(min * 60)
